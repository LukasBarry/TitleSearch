This app was created for North Carolina attorneys to do title searches in one third the time with a much easier to use format. TitleSearch allows the attorney to input their client information in an online form and submit it, at which point the app will search the open data sources of the county and return all of the public information, including the tax records and any open deeds of trust on record with the county.

Once the attorney has reviewed the information returned by the database, they will be able to choose what title company they would like their preliminary title opinion sent to, hit submit again, and it will be sent directly over, saving both time and money.

To begin use on this app, fork the repository, clone it, then:

run `bundle install`

and because this uses a postgreSQL database, please run

`rake db:create`

Now you will be able to start your rails server and run the app from your localhost.

More information will be provided once the app is released for Beta testing.

Thanks!

**This app is currently being built, so it will not work at the moment. Please bear with me.**
